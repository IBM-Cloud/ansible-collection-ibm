Parameters
----------

  apikey (False, str, None)
    You can optionally passthrough the API key value for this API key. If passed, NO validation of that apiKey value is done, i.e. the value can be non-URL safe. If omitted, the API key management will create an URL safe opaque API key value. The value of the API key is checked for uniqueness. Please ensure enough variations when passing in this value.


  description (False, str, None)
    The optional description of the API key. The 'description' property is only available if a description was provided during a create of an API key.


  store_value (False, bool, None)
    Send true or false to set whether the API key value is retrievable in the future by using the Get details of an API key request. If you create an API key for a user, you must specify `false` or omit the value. We don't allow storing of API keys for users.


  name (True, str, None)
    (Required for new resource) Name of the API key. The name is not checked for uniqueness. Therefore multiple names with the same value can exist. Access is done via the UUID of the API key.


  file (False, str, None)
    File where api key is to be stored


  entity_lock (False, str, False)
    Indicates if the API key is locked for further write operations. False by default.


  id (False, str, None)
    (Required when updating or destroying existing resource) IBM Cloud Resource ID.


  state (False, any, available)
    State of resource


  iaas_classic_username (False, any, None)
    (Required when generation = 1) The IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure (SoftLayer) user name. This can also be provided via the environment variable 'IAAS_CLASSIC_USERNAME'.


  iaas_classic_api_key (False, any, None)
    (Required when generation = 1) The IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure API key. This can also be provided via the environment variable 'IAAS_CLASSIC_API_KEY'.


  region (False, any, us-south)
    The IBM Cloud region where you want to create your resources. If this value is not specified, us-south is used by default. This can also be provided via the environment variable 'IC_REGION'.


  ibmcloud_api_key (True, any, None)
    The IBM Cloud API key to authenticate with the IBM Cloud platform. This can also be provided via the environment variable 'IC_API_KEY'.
